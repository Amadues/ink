To decide which code is the most preferred way, users can comment and vote against a fight for their favourite contender.” The site is divided into categories by programming languages, and there doesn’t seem to be a lot here yet, but you can help by adding to it and starting some “code fights”.

Finally, a native Mac or iOS app that is “an API Documentation Browser and Code Snippet Manager. Dash stores snippets of code and instantly searches offline documentation sets for 150+ APIs.” This one’s great for pretty much any kind of developer.
